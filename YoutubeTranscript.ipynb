Sutter: \"I decided to essentially, for all intents and purposes, get rid of the thing for a month\" \"It took about a week to adjust downward into a new, progressivelylower level of stimulation,\" he says .\\', \\' Aims to get to the bottom of what it takes to focus in a world of distraction . Pored over hundreds of research papers from front to back at his office . Travelled out to meet experts around the world who study focus . Had 25,000 words of research notes about why this is the case .\\', \" We pay attention to the world around us and how much control we have over our focus. We think the problem is that our brains are distracted. But after looking at the research, this is what I\\'ve come to know is the root cause of this distraction. It\\'s not that we\\'re distracted; it\\'s that we crave distraction. Our brains love these tiny little nuggets of information and social media .\", \\' There\\\\\\'s even a mechanism in our mind called the \"novelty bias,\" by which our mind rewards us with a hit of dopamine, one of those wonderful pleasure chemicals . So, this is the state of our minds today. We\\\\\\'re at this hyperstimulated state where we bounce around between objects of attention that are very, very stimulating for our mind. And so, you know, this feeling that we experience when we go from being high stimulation into a state of low stimulation, it has a n\\', \\' \"Boredom\" is the restlessness that we feel when we have a busy week and then we\\\\\\'re lying on the couch, thinking, \"Alright, well, what am I doing now?\" So, I put out a call to the readers of my website and I asked them, \"What is the most boring thing you can think of doing? I\\\\\\'m going to make myself bored,\" he says .\\', \" It took about a week for my mind to adjust downward into a newer, lower level of stimulation . Research shows that it takes about eight days to fully calm down and rest, like when we\\'re on vacation . But I also noticed that my attention span expanded. I was able to focus more easily because I wasn\\'t surrounded by fewer distractions .\", \\' When your best, most brilliant ideas strike you, you\\\\\\'re rarely focused on something . This is a mode, especially when we do this deliberately, when we deliberately let our mind wander, is called \"scatter focus\" Research shows that it lets our mind come up with ideas, and it also helps our mind plan because of where our mind wanders to .\\', \\' We think about the past less than we might think, only about 12% of the time . But the present is a much more productive place to wander - we wander to think about present 28% of time . Whenever our mind is wandering, we think about future more than the past and the present combined .\\', \" It\\'s because the rest of the time, our mind is dull, it\\'s blank, or it doesn\\'t have an idea inside of it that is rooted in time . But whatever it is for you - it might be taking that extra long shower, or taking a bath . It might be something simple, something that doesn\\'t consume your full attention .\", \" We thin oak not just with your body but with your ideas as well as your ideas . Ask your masseuse to let you know you have a notepad in the session because ideas always come to you. You\\'re always incubating things, so capture them so you can act upon them later. It could be something as simple as waiting in line .\", \" We don\\'t need to fit more in. We\\'re doing enough; we\\'re doing too much. This is when our best ideas and plans come to us. We need more space. We like to think of distraction as the enemy of focus. It is a symptom of why we find it difficult to focus, which is the fact that our mind is overstimulated.
